# Elder Mouse
This was a project for a class 3D sculpting I followed.

## Description
This is the Elder Mouse. His life started as a normal mouse. But one day he had a urge for cheese and he heard that there was a castle where there was some great old blue cheese. When he found the cheese and was busy eating he didn't notice the old programmer sneaking up on him. Everything became dark. And when he awoke he had a ball in his stomach and his ears had switches connected to them. Also his tail felt real heavy because it was extended and stuck somewhere. But he didn't have hunger anymore, because behind a trapdoor on his belly there was some nice blue cheese.
